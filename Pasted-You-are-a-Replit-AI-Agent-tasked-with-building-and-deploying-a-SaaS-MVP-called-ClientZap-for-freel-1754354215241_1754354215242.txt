You are a Replit AI Agent tasked with building and deploying a SaaS MVP called "ClientZap" for freelancers to automate client onboarding, targeting paying customers ($15–40/month) in 4–6 weeks. I’m a solo founder with basic coding skills, starting with zero followers, and need to protect the idea from theft. Build a secure, private, visually polished web app in Replit using HTML/CSS/JS (frontend), Node.js (backend), and SQLite (database), integrating free-tier APIs (DocuSign for e-signatures, Calendly for scheduling). The app must be user-friendly, conversion-focused, and deployable on Replit’s free or Hacker plan ($7/month). Deliver clean, commented code, a professional UI, and marketing-ready elements (e.g., landing page) to drive sign-ups. Provide setup and deployment instructions for Replit.

### Project Requirements
**Core Features**:
1. **Client Intake Form Builder**:
   - Drag-and-drop interface for freelancers to create custom forms (fields: client name, email, project details, budget).
   - Modern, responsive UI (use Tailwind CSS for clean, professional styling).
   - Store form data in SQLite.
   - Generate a shareable form link for clients to fill out.
2. **Contract Generation**:
   - Create a PDF contract from a template (use form data: client name, project scope, budget).
   - Integrate DocuSign API (free tier) for e-signatures, sending contracts to clients.
   - Store contract status (e.g., “Sent,” “Signed”) in SQLite.
3. **Scheduling Integration**:
   - Embed Calendly API (free tier) for clients to book calls after form submission.
   - Link bookings to form data in the dashboard.
4. **Dashboard**:
   - Clean, intuitive UI showing client list, form status (e.g., “Sent,” “Completed”), contract status, and booking status.
   - Use Tailwind CSS for a modern, professional look (e.g., card-based layout, soft colors like blue/white).
   - Include a “Send New Form” button and client progress bars.
   - Secure with email/password login (Node.js authentication, bcrypt for passwords).
5. **Landing Page**:
   - Marketing-optimized page to drive waitlist sign-ups (Mailchimp form integration, free tier).
   - Headline: “ClientZap: Automate Freelancer Onboarding in Minutes.”
   - Subheadline: “Save 5+ hours/week on client forms, contracts, and scheduling.”
   - Include a mockup screenshot (dashboard with client list, progress bars).
   - CTA: “Join Waitlist for Early Access” (Mailchimp form).
   - Design: Clean, modern, conversion-focused (use Tailwind CSS, hero section, testimonial placeholder).

**Technical Requirements**:
- **Stack**: HTML/CSS/JS (frontend, Tailwind CSS), Node.js (backend, Express.js), SQLite (database).
- **APIs**: DocuSign (free tier, e-signatures), Calendly (free tier, scheduling).
- **Security**: Private Replit project, password-protected beta access, secure login (bcrypt).
- **Cost**: Use Replit free tier (Hacker plan, $7/month, if needed). Free APIs only.
- **Performance**: Lightweight app, fast load times (<2s), responsive design (mobile-friendly).
- **Comments**: Add clear comments for each code section (e.g., “Form submission handler”).
- **Dependencies**: Minimize packages (e.g., express, sqlite3, bcrypt, axios for APIs).

**Design Requirements** (Graphic Designer Perspective):
- UI: Modern, clean, professional (Tailwind CSS, blue/white palette, rounded buttons, card-based dashboard).
- UX: Intuitive navigation (e.g., sidebar for dashboard, form builder, settings).
- Mockup: Embed a high-fidelity dashboard screenshot in the landing page (client list, progress bars, “Book Call” button).
- Branding: Use “ClientZap” logo (simple text-based, bold font, blue accent) for consistency.

**Marketing Requirements** (Marketing Professional Perspective):
- Landing page optimized for conversions: Clear headline, benefits (save time, impress clients), strong CTA.
- Include placeholder testimonial: “Saved me 2 hours per client!” — Freelancer.
- Mailchimp form for waitlist sign-ups, linked to SQLite for tracking.
- Demo-ready: Generate a 1-minute demo video script for Loom (e.g., “Create form → send contract → book call”).
- SEO: Basic meta tags for “freelancer onboarding tool” to support future growth.

**Deliverables**:
1. Replit project structure (files: index.html, style.css, app.js, server.js, database.sql).
2. Commented code for all features (form builder, contract generation, scheduling, dashboard, landing page).
3. Setup instructions for Replit (e.g., npm install, API key setup).
4. DocuSign and Calendly API integration steps (free-tier accounts).
5. Deployment steps for Replit hosting (free or Hacker plan, password-protected).
6. Mockup screenshot code (HTML/CSS) for landing page.
7. Timeline for build (2–3 weeks for solo founder, 10–15 hours/week).

**Constraints**:
- Build for Replit’s free tier (upgrade to Hacker if needed).
- Keep code simple for a beginner to tweak.
- Avoid public sharing to protect the idea.
- Suggest no-code alternatives (e.g., Zapier) if a feature is complex.

**Timeline**:
- Day 1–2: Landing page, form builder UI.
- Day 3–7: Backend (Node.js, SQLite), DocuSign integration.
- Day 8–14: Calendly integration, dashboard UI, login.
- Day 15–21: Testing, polish, deployment.
